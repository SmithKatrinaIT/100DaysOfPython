"""
Lesson 1: printing
 -- To print text to the console or in your program
 -- Strings (text to print out ---- it is not code) surrounded by double quotes or single quotes
 -- Python does not use semi-colons at the end of a statement block
 -- use input() function to provide a prompt to the user to get text back from the user

 NOTE: Python does not allow mix data types to be concatenated in a print statement
must use 'f' string formating to use multiply data types in a print statement

print("Hello World")

print("Hello " + input("What is your name? ") + "!")
print('1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.')
print('2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.')
print('3. Add 3g of Salt.')
print('4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.')
print('5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.')

Concept 2: Comments
 -- use pound (#) for single-line comments
 -- use 3 double (") or single (') quotes for multi-line comments

    Coding Exercise: Squaring Numbers -
    -- You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers.
    -- This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.
        e.g. 4 * 4 = 16

    **DO NOT** modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
    Target Output: [1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]

    -- First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers called numbers.   
    -- Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result.

Concept: Functions
 -- functions perform different types of functionality that can be reused throughout a program/script
 -- Use 'def' keyword to define a function code block
 -- Syntax: 'def function_name:'
 -- To call (execute) a function; use the name of the function followed by set of parenthesis ()
"""

# print function
print("Hello")

# length function
num_char = len("Hello")
print(num_char)


def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

# calling (executing) the custom function
my_function()

 -- Indentation: use of (4) spaces (preferred indentation method) and tabs to specify blocks of code
 -- tabs should only be used to maintain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs
 -- Python3 does not allow mixing of tabs and spaces for indentation
